# Telecommunication Systems II - 2022 Assignment

## Prequesites:
  
  1. Have Python installed
  2. Install **Numpy**, **Scipy**, **Matplotlib** and **Polygon** libraries. The following commands may be used:
	
	pip install numpy
	
	pip install scipy
	
	pip install matplotlib
	
	pip install Polygon3

 
 
## How to run:
  
  1. Run **Simulation.py** to get results for part 1 of the assignment (Validation of SEP estimation methods)
  2. Run **DetectionMethodsComparison.py** to get results for part 2 of the assignment (Comparison of average detection time for different detection methods)
  3. Run **ConstellationPlots.py** to get a visualization of Regular-Irregular HQAM constellations and their decision regions.

Note: Some parameters (such as constellation size, d_min etc.) may be easily edited by adjusting the corresponding variables in the Python code.
